# honey_production

This is a project from Codecademy that focuses on using a linear regression with real-world data to predict the outcome of honey production decades into the future.

The plight of the honeybee has been well documented in the last decade plus of research, but itâ€™s important to understand what the future of honey production will look like over the next few decades to prepare for all possibilities and of course try to fix this issue before the decline becomes difficult to return from. This project only assesses what honey production may look like in the future, not the various issues currently facing honeybee populations.

Structure:
This project utilizes the following:
